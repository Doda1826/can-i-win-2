Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things
Can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forgetgit

Furthering my distance from you
Realistically I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you
Keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy

Straight up ahead you'll find a sign
That says you can't get by with a lie
But if I stayed away by a thread from the glory path
And made my life harder, lying 'bout the stupid shit I say
Then you wouldn't know a single thing about
How I feel about you
And those really dumb things people feel
